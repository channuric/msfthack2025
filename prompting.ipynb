With the capabilities of Gateway Load Balancer, you can easily deploy, scale, and manage NVAs. Chaining a Gateway Load Balancer to your public endpoint only requires one selection. You can insert appliances transparently for different kinds of scenarios such as: Firewalls Advanced packet analytics Intrusion detection and prevention systems Traffic mirroring DDoS protection Custom appliances With Gateway Load Balancer, you can easily add or remove advanced network functionality without extra management overhead. It provides the bump-in-the-wire technology you need to ensure all traffic to and from a public endpoint is first sent to the appliance before your application. In scenarios with NVAs, it's especially important that flows are symmetrical. Gateway Load Balancer maintains flow stickiness to a specific instance in the backend pool along with flow symmetry. As a result, a consistent route to your network virtual appliance is ensured â\\x80\\x93 without further manual configuration. As a result, packets traverse the same network path in both directions and appliances that need this key capability are able to function seamlessly. The health probe listens across all ports and routes traffic to the backend instances using the HA ports rule. Traffic sent to and from Gateway Load Balancer uses the VXLAN protocol. \",\n  'images': ['<img alt=\"Diagram of gateway load balancer\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\" src=\"media/gateway-overview/gateway-load-balancer-diagram.png\"/>'],\n  'img_alt': ['Diagram of gateway load balancer'],\n  'tables': [],\n  'codes': ['<code>Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/frontendIPConfigurations/join/action</code>']},\n {'title': 'Benefits',\n  'tag': 'h2',\n  'text': 'Benefits Gateway Load Balancer has the following benefits: Gateway Load Balancer has the following benefits: Integrate virtual appliances transparently into the network path.

The addition of advanced networking capabilities in a specific sequence is known as service chaining. As a result, this reference is called a chain.

The load balancer automatically updates itself if you add or remove computers, without needing extra work.\\n   - (A backend pool is just the team of computers that helps with requests.)\\n\\n4. Tunnel interfaces – Tunnel interfaces act like doors between the Gateway Load Balancer and the computers behind it. There are two kinds:\\n   - External: Used for traffic coming into your backend pool.\\n   - Internal: Used for traffic leaving your appliances and going to the main app.\\n   Each group of computers (backend pool) can have up to two tunnel interfaces.\\n   - (Tunnel interfaces are ways traffic moves between different points.)\\n\\n5. Chain – Sometimes, you need to send network traffic through several helpful tools in order, like scanning for security and then sharing the work. Doing this is called \\'service chaining’, and when you set it up, it is called a \\'chain.\\' Chains can work across different accounts (‘cross tenant’). To set this up, you must be allowed to connect different resources together and have guest access to the Gateway Load Balancer’s account.\\n   - (\\'Service chaining\\' means sending traffic through a set order of helpers.)\\n   - (A ‘Cross tenant chain’ is when this happens between different owners/accounts.)\\n   - (The ‘resource provider operation’ mentioned is just a special access permission needed to set up these connections.)\\n   - (‘Guest access to the subscription’ means you can see and use the load balancer, even if you don’t own the account.)\\n\\nIf you see terms like \"Virtual Machine Scale Set\", it just means a group of virtual computers that can easily grow or shrink in number. “Automatic reconfiguration” means the system switches things around by itself if you add or remove computers. “Virtual network” means all the connected devices and computers working together in your private setup.'},\n {'title': 'Pricing',\n  'tag': 'h2',\n  'text': 'Pricing For pricing, see Load Balancer pricing .
