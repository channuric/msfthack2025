To scale cost-effectively to meet high volumes of incoming traffic, computing guidelines generally recommend adding more instances to the backend pool. Load Balancer instantly reconfigures itself via automatic reconfiguration when you scale instances up or down. Adding or removing VMs from the backend pool reconfigures the load balancer without extra operations. The scope of the backend pool is any virtual machine in a single virtual network.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Tunnel interfaces</strong> - Gateway Load balancer backend pools have another component called the tunnel interfaces. The tunnel interface enables the appliances in the backend to ensure network flows are handled as expected. Each backend pool can have up to two tunnel interfaces. Tunnel interfaces can be either internal or external. For traffic coming to your backend pool, you should use the external type. For traffic going from your appliance to the application, you should use the internal type.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Chain</strong> - A Gateway Load Balancer can be referenced by a Standard Public Load Balancer frontend or a Standard Public IP configuration on a virtual machine. The addition of advanced networking capabilities in a specific sequence is known as service chaining. As a result, this reference is called a chain.

Adding advanced network features in order is called service chaining, and this is known as a chain. A <i>cross tenant chain</i> happens when you chain a Load Balancer frontend or Public IP to a Gateway Load Balancer in a different subscription. For cross tenant chaining, you need:\\n  <ul>\\n    <li>Permission for the resource provider operation <b>Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/frontendIPConfigurations/join/action</b>.</li>\\n    <li>Guest access to the subscription where the Gateway Load Balancer is set up.</li>\\n  </ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"paragraph\",\n                    \"text\": \"\\n<p>Gateway Load Balancer consists of the following components:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p><strong>Frontend IP configuration</strong> - The IP address of your Gateway Load Balancer. This IP is private only.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Load-balancing rules</strong> - A load balancer rule is used to define how incoming traffic is distributed to\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00afall\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00afthe instances within the backend pool. A load-balancing rule maps a given frontend IP configuration and port to multiple backend IP addresses and ports.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>Gateway Load Balancer rules can only be HA port rules.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>A Gateway Load Balancer rule can be associated with up to two backend pools.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Backend pool(s)</strong> - The group of virtual machines or instances in a Virtual Machine Scale Set that is serving the incoming request. To scale cost-effectively to meet high volumes of incoming traffic, computing guidelines generally recommend adding more instances to the backend pool. Load Balancer instantly reconfigures itself via automatic reconfiguration when you scale instances up or down. Adding or removing VMs from the backend pool reconfigures the load balancer without extra operations. The scope of the backend pool is any virtual machine in a single virtual network.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Tunnel interfaces</strong> - Gateway Load balancer backend pools have another component called the tunnel interfaces. The tunnel interface enables the appliances in the backend to ensure network flows are handled as expected. Each backend pool can have up to two tunnel interfaces. Tunnel interfaces can be either internal or external. For traffic coming to your backend pool, you should use the external type. For traffic going from your appliance to the application, you should use the internal type.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Chain</strong> - A Gateway Load Balancer can be referenced by a Standard Public Load Balancer frontend or a Standard Public IP configuration on a virtual machine. The addition of advanced networking capabilities in a specific sequence is known as service chaining. As a result, this reference is called a chain. A Cross tenant chain involves chaining a Load Balancer frontend or Public IP configuration to a Gateway Load Balancer that is in another subscription. For cross tenant chaining, users need:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Permission for the resource provider operation <code>Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/frontendIPConfigurations/join/action</code>.</li>\\n<li>Guest access to the subscription of the Gateway Load Balancer.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n\"\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"section-6\",\n            \"title\": \"Pricing\",\n            \"content\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"paragraph\",\n                    \"text\": \"To find out how much it costs, please look at <a data-linktype=\\\"external\\\" href=\\\"https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/load-balancer/\\\">Load Balancer pricing</a>.\\n\\n<b>Explanation:</b>\\n<ul>\\n  <li><i>Load Balancer pricing</i> is a page that shows how much money you need to pay to use the Azure Gateway Load Balancer.
